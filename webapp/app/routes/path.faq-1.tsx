        Before Nopal, we consulted and built many projects and know every build
        is unique. Different projects value different aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to help answer this question, we’ll examine a few types of homes
        we’ve seen built.

        Code Minimum House
      </h2>
      <p>
        This house is built as cheap and fast as possible. Often these barely
        meet code. So how do we rank this type of home?
      </p>
      <Annotation>We think we can close the gap on cost.</Annotation>
      <p>
        <b>Build Cost:</b> Good. Out of all the homes we’re comparing this one
        is the cheapest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Operational Cost:</b> Lacking. While this isn’t the most energy
        efficient in the bunch, it is going to have the most predictable
        maintenance and home failures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Health:</b> Bad. There is no air filtration and air quality is going
        to depend on the current weather.
      </p>

      <h2 className="cacti-two-heading">
        <CactiTwo />
        Bolt-on High Performance House
      </h2>
      <Annotation>
        We’ve consulted on many builds like this. We see the same mistakes on
        repeat.
      </Annotation>
      <p>
        This house is built using traditional methods. You could mistake it for
        a code minimum on first glance. They opt for spray foam and miss
        important air sealing details.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Build Cost:</b> Bad. These homes often end up twice as expensive as
        the code minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Operational Cost:</b> Terrible. By opting for spray foam they’ll need
        major repairs every ~20 years, each time degrading the performance.
      </p>
      <Annotation>Seriously, foam is bad.</Annotation>
      <p>
        <b>Health:</b> Bad. Foam is toxic and flammable.
      </p>

        <CactiThree />
        Nopal Home
      </h2>
      <Annotation>
        This is our assumption we are validating in Spring 2025
      </Annotation>
      <p>
        Because we use <Link to="/path/faq-2">our baselayer</Link> that seeks to
        use off-the-shelf part that are human movable, it ends up being
        remarkably cost effective while punching above the passive house
        standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Build Cost:</b> Okay. We aren’t the Code minimum but we are
        significantly cheaper than the Bolt-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Operational Cost:</b> Amazing. That’s all there is to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Health:</b> Amazing. From a Zehnder to acoustic absorbsion ceiling to
        natural materials.

        Nopal homes are built to stay performant with minimal maintenance for
        70+ years. Repairing the home is possible with minimal effort and waste
        compared to the other types listed because of{" "}
        <Link to="/path/faq-2">our baselayer</Link>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bolt-on high performance and code minimum homes have more serious points
        of failure. In our experience 50 years is a long time for these types of
        homes before major remodel or a complete rebuild is needed.
