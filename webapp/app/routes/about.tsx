              Sitting on a beach at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, 3 days from
              my last indoor meal, I had a realization. Magical things happen on
              days that start and end in nature, void of connection to the
              modern world. My brain was at total ease, I felt more....human, my
              challenges were clear, the world was all in balance. The power of
              “the middle day” has fascinated me for two decades, now confirmed

              Back on my Grandpa's farm, I fell in love with nature without
              knowing it. It wasn't a specific aspect but rather the collective.
              Sometimes nature was full of life and other times it struggled to
              survive. Worst was to see how we humans tried to force nature to
              adapt to our approach to life.

              Laying in a hospital bed beneath synthetic light. I kept thinking
              how on earth am I expected to heal in a building this bad?
              Realizing I needed to drop my path to medical school to create
              healthy buildings that are connected to nature.

              Suddenly I was deeply emerged in the Costa Rican wilderness on a
              tropical biology study abroad program. Reconnecting to my
              childhood roots digging in the dirt, camping, hiking, and playing
              in nature. Feeling healthier than I had in years. It became
              obvious that we needed to make buildings places centered around
              healing while minimizing their impact to people and the planet.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mt-4 mb-20">
              This core realization led me to spending the last two decades as a
              building scientist focused on creating the healthiest buildings
              with the lowest lifecycle carbon impact.
