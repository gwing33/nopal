          <CactiOne /> A Fragmented Understanding
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our industry has splintered into fragmented understanding. The few
          people that see the whole aren’t doing the hands on work, separated by
          regulations and meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bolting on high performance has become a common path to achieve more
          resilient and healthy buildings. While the results can be positive,
          the added complexity leads to increased cost, complication and
          uncertainty.

          At Nopal, we focus on bringing these fragments into a clear whole,
          through a complete system.

          What We Are Looking For
        </h3>
        <p>Investors or on-contract buyers for builds #2-10.</p>

        <p>These first 10 builds enable us to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refine our education and community approach</li>
          <li>Grow the Team</li>
          <li>
            Level up <Link to="/path/faq-2">our Baselayer</Link> system
          </li>
          <li>Start warehousing and prefab operations</li>
          <li>Improve our project management software</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="cacti-four-heading">
          <CactiFour />
          The Future is Multi
        </h3>
        <p>
          Based on our research, about 12-20 homes per acre is the optimal
          American city density for thriving communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We plan to scale to multifamily projects designed around human scale
          clusters and built with our Atomic Teams. Developing our systems and
          team approach takes time. We are pursuing slow and deliberate growth
          to build a lasting future. After our first 10 homes we look to immerse
          ourselves into the multifamily market with confidence.
