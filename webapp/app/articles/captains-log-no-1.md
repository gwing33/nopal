# Captians Log No.1

## Capitian Speaking.
There is a lot to do here. We need to start making things dynamic.

There are 3 main columns at the moment:
1. Notions *noun*: An individual's conception or impression of something known, experienced, or imagined
2. Markdown *markup*: Lightweight markup language.
3. Annotatings *verb*: to make or furnish critical or explanatory notes or comment.

These are all parts of our speech. We can use these 3 things to help us navigate the world.
If we need more than these, then we need to ask ourselves, what am I trying to do?

### The Rule of 3 Pillars
And we swear, that the 3 pillars are all we need.
We need no more and should correct our trajectory to maintain the ethos of these 3 pillars.
This is why we make an oath that these be always observed:
- responsive
- zoom in/out
- middle column limits page height

### Imagine
Column isn't really the right word.
The traditional layout is in 3 columns.
However, let's say you want a photo album the *annotatings* could be betwixt the photos.

### No.tebook System
But yes, we do need a system. This one becomes critical to the whole operation.
But it's a simple one.
When you format a markdown title like this, `Space aAzZ No.1`, you can think of this as adding a notion to your notebook.
In fact, sometimes I label a physical notebook on the binding with the same title.

Now this can be linked from other notions.
For example, `Space aAzZ No.1: A Title` can be linked by doing the following `[Space aAzZ No.1](#space-aazz-no1)`.
Eventually it'd be good to have an autocomplete for this.
Like `[S` would bring up all `No.` tags that start with `S`, like `Space sSsS No.3`.

Now...you could give your notions more sensible names like `Note No.1` or `Thought No.73: What aboot a version?` or you could even give them duplicate name: `Thought No.73: Oh, version 2 is here.`.
You're simply creating a version.

But what if you didn't mean to version something?
No worries, just number it different and it'll de-version it.

What if I don't want to give it a number? It's just an uncooked thought?
That's fine too, simply give it a question mark instead of a number: `Thought No.?`.
This is treated as an uncooked thought.
Uncooked thoughts are good for simple ideas, see [Uncooked Thoughts](#to-do-uncooked-thoughts) for more.


## Access
Eventually it'd be great to give someone, group or make public your notations. They would be static views, if you wanted to edit you simply checkout the notion and offer up an edit or turn it into something different.

Everything is moderation because everything is owned.

## Style
If we allow SVGs to be background or annotatings, this could be a level of personalization that is unmatched. Simply copy SVG from Figma or similar tool and paste it in.

## Over and out.
At the end of each page, we should look to see if there are any additional tasks to be completed for this document.
For this entry, it seems like these are ideas I'd like to explore.
- [x] Imagine
- [ ] Create #uncooked-thoughts-todo (auto generate from above)
- [ ] Link to other pages
- [ ] Tasking by MD
