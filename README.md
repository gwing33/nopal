We are a company focused on building homes for humans. Everything we do is open source and transparent. We look to learn and share all our information.

This repo houses all our software that helps us communicate, learn and share knowledge as well as provides us a space to build software tooling that can help us manage projects, cost estimates and define wall assemblies.
